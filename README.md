Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering methods, principles, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software programs.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry today because it allows the creation of software and applications that makes everyday life easier.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programing languages
Establishing software engineering in 1960
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:  gather and document user needs and what is required for the systems
Design: craft detailed and high-quality software architecture and user interface
Implementation: write a code and build software as per design instructions
Testing: conduct several tests to ensure the software meets its standards and functionality requirements
Deployment: releasing the software to the user
Maintenance; providing support, updates, and any advances on the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology follows a sequential pattern of clear phrases flowing down like a waterfall, while agile is an iterative and incremental program that focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and responding to change. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer; responsible for writing codes, implementing and providing software solutions
Quality Assurance: conducting several tests and ensuring high-quality software design specifications are met
Project manager: responsible for planning, executing, and software deployment


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment; these are software suites that supply tools for writing, debugging and testing codes like Visual Studio and IntelliJ IDEA
version Control Systems: these are software tools for tracing a change in source code and coordinating work across all  team members such as; Git and subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines; software developers to be taking projects without tight deadlines to avoid delivering software with compromised quality 
Change in requirements: developers should ensure they get the exact requirements that will meet clients' standards and specifications, and ensure they are what they need to avoid project delays

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Testing unit; is the testing of modules or components in a software
 Testing integration; conducting tests checking interractions between different subsystems or modules
 Testing system: testing the whole software system
 Acceptance Testing; testing the software against the user interface to check if all requirements are met
 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the crafting of questions and statements to get the best response from AI
Prompt engineering is important as it helps you craft the right and clear prompts so the AI can understand exactly what you need



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Help me find the best hotels on the coast
Help me find the best 5-star hotels on the  South Coast that have swimming pools and child-friendly
The second prompt is best because I have told the AI what I'm looking for, so the results will be exactly what I need, but the first one if vogues since I haven't specified what kind of hotel I want, where on the coast and what specifications
